## Developers ✨

Developers can use this documentation to learn how to build Web Awesome from source. You will need Node.js 14.17 or later to build and run the project locally.

**You don't need to do any of this to use Web Awesome!** This page is for people who want to contribute to the project, tinker with the source, or create a custom build of Web Awesome.

If that's not what you're trying to do, the [documentation website](https://webawesome.com) is where you want to be.

### What are you using to build Web Awesome?

Components are built with [Lit](https://lit.dev/), a custom elements base class that provides an intuitive API and reactive data binding. The build is a custom script with bundling powered by [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

### Understanding the Web Awesome monorepo

Web Awesome uses [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/using-npm/workspaces) for its monorepo structure and is fairly minimal in what it provides.

By using npm workspaces and a monorepo structure, we can get consistent builds, shared configurations, and reduced duplication across repositories which reduces regressions and forces consistency across `webawesome`, `webawesome-pro`, and `webawesome-app`.

Generally, if you plan to only work with the free version of `webawesome` it is easiest to go to `packages/webawesome` and run all commands from there.

### Where do npm dependencies go?

Any dependencies intended to be used across all packages (i.e., `prettier`, `eslint`) that are **not** used at runtime should be in the root `devDependencies` of `package.json`.

```bash
npm install -D -w prettier
```

Any dependencies that will be used at runtime by a package should be part of the specific package's `dependencies` such as `lit`. This is required because if that dependency is not in the `packages/*/package.json`, it will not be installed when used via npm.

Individual packages are also free to install `devDependencies` as needed as long as they are specific to that package only.

To install a package specific to a Web Awesome package, change your working directory to that package's root (i.e., `cd packages/webawesome && npm install <package-name>`).

### Forking the Repo

Start by [forking the repo](https://github.com/shoelace-style/webawesome/fork) on GitHub, then clone it locally and install dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/webawesome
cd webawesome
npm install
```

### Developing

Once you've cloned the repo, run the following command from the respective directory within `packages/*`.

```bash
cd packages/webawesome
npm start
```

This will spin up the dev server. After the initial build, a browser will open automatically. There is currently no hot module reloading (HMR), as browsers don't provide a way to reregister custom elements, but most changes to the source will reload the browser automatically.

### Building

To generate a production build, run the following command.

```bash
cd packages/webawesome
npm run build
```

You can also run `npm run build:serve` to start an [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) instance on `http://localhost:4000` after the build completes, so you can preview the production build.

### Creating New Components

To scaffold a new component, run the following command, replacing `wa-tag-name` with the desired tag name.

```bash
cd packages/webawesome
npm run create wa-tag-name
```

This will generate a source file, a stylesheet, and a docs page for you. When you start the dev server, you'll find the new component in the "Components" section of the sidebar.

### Adding additional packages

Right now the only additional packages are in private repositories.

To add additional packages from other repositories, run `git clone <url> packages/<package-name>` to clone your repo into `packages/`.

Make sure to run `npm install` at the root of the monorepo after adding your package!

### Contributing

Web Awesome is an open source project and contributions are encouraged! If you're interesting in contributing, please review the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
