Web Awesome follows <a href="https://semver.org/" class="appearance-plain">Semantic Versioning</a>, and each release on this page follows the <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/" class="appearance-plain">Keep a Changelog</a> convention. Additionally, both [components](/docs/components) and features carry a status badge that tells you what to expect from their API.

## 3.10.0

<small><time datetime="2026-06-30">June 30th, 2026</time></small>

:::added

- Added the experimental `<wa-random-content>` component, which randomly shows one or more of its children — handy for rotating testimonials, tips, or featured content
- Added the Mosaic, Pixel, Vellum, Slab Duo, and Slab Press Duo Pro+ icon families to `<wa-icon>` [pr:2562]
- Added the `buzz`, `flip-360`, `float`, `jello`, `spin-snap`, `spin-snap-4`, `spin-snap-8`, `swing`, and `wag` animations to `<wa-icon>` [pr:2562]
- Added the `canvas` attribute to `<wa-icon>` for choosing the icon canvas — `fixed` (default), `auto`, `square`, or `roomy` [pr:2562]

:::

:::fixed

- Fixed a type issue in `<wa-checkbox>` that caused the `name` property to have an incorrect type. [pr:2568]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-page>` causing the viewport to always overflow if a footer was present. [pr:2537]
- Fixed a bug in `wa-video` that was causing the `z-index` to leak out of the context of the component [issue:2542]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-chart>` and its variants that threw a `DataCloneError` when the Chart.js config contained functions, such as tooltip or scale callbacks
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-date-input>` and `<wa-time-input>` where an empty `start`/`end` slot added a phantom gap causing it to be misaligned with other form controls [issue:2527]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-select>` that prevented the dropdown menu from scrolling when using the keyboard [issue:2472]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-carousel>` that caused the pagination controls to clip vertically by adding block padding around them [issue:2495]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-carousel>` with `loop` enabled that displayed the wrong slide, briefly flashing it on load, when the carousel was initialized inside a hidden container such as an inactive tab panel [issue:1163]
- Fixed component API tables in the `webawesome` Agent Skill by generating them from the CEM instead of scraping the rendered HTML [issue:2475]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-known-date>` that showed validation errors while typing instead of on form submission like other form controls
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-known-date>` where the validation tooltip always pointed to the first input regardless of which one was invalid
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-toast-item>` where the documented `--padding` custom property was unused in component styles
- Aligned the `start` and `end` slot region in `<wa-date-input>` and `<wa-time-input>` with `<wa-input>` and `<wa-select>`
  - The trailing calendar/clock and clear icons no longer sit a few pixels inward of where the other controls place them
  - The `start` and `end` slots now use the same spacing as the other controls instead of a tighter gap

:::

:::changed

- Synced `<wa-option>` visuals with `<wa-dropdown-item>` so options and menu items read as the same primitive [issue:2413]
  - `<wa-option>` now uses rounded corners and sits inset within `<wa-select>`'s listbox, with spacing between options
  - The current (keyboard-highlighted) state now uses `--wa-form-control-activated-color` for its background and a new `--current-text-color` custom property for its text, so options track form control theming alongside `<wa-checkbox>`, `<wa-radio>`, `<wa-switch>`, and `<wa-slider>`
  - Hover and current state changes now animate, matching `<wa-dropdown-item>`
- Reordered component reference pages in the `webawesome` Agent Skill to put the import instructions and API tables before the examples
- Rewrote `prose.css` rules with `@scope` so that `wa-prose` and `wa-not-prose` classes are proximity aware. This ensures that nested instances of either class work as expected, no matter the nesting depth. [pr:2564]
- Updated `<wa-icon>` to use [Font Awesome 7.3.0](https://fontawesome.com/changelog#v7-3-0) [pr:2562]
- Aligned `<wa-icon>` animation defaults with Font Awesome 7.3.0 — `flip`, `shake`, `fade`, and `beat-fade` use updated timing, duration, and keyframes [pr:2562]

:::

:::deprecated

- Deprecated the `auto-width` attribute on `<wa-icon>` in favor of `canvas="auto"` [pr:2562]

:::

## 3.9.0

<small><time datetime="2026-06-18">June 18th, 2026</time></small>

:::added

- Added a `dist/ssr/all.js` endpoint for making SSR integration easier. Scoped under `/ssr` to make it clear this file is intended for _servers_ as importing everything on the client is heavy, and instead users should cherry-pick client imports. [pr:2520]
- Added a `webawesome-design` [Agent Skill](/docs/ai/agent-skills) that teaches AI tools how to design with Web Awesome
- Added a `choosing-components` decision tree to the `webawesome` Agent Skill so AI tools pick the right component by intent instead of guessing from names
- Added `npm run verify:skills` (also wired into `npm run verify`) that cross-checks Agent Skill content against the Custom Elements Manifest so silent drift can't ship
- Added the `<wa-checkbox-group>` component [pr:2514]
- Added `leaf-multiple` as a new `selection` option for `<wa-tree>`, allowing multiple leaf nodes to be selected while parent nodes only expand and collapse. [pr:2486]
- Added support for grouping native `<button>` elements in `<wa-button-group>` when Native Styles are included [issue:2510] [pr:2515]

:::

:::fixed

- Fixed a bug in SSR polyfills for the style property. This fixes `<wa-progress-bar>` not properly serializing on the server. [pr:2517]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-color-picker>` where initial values in SSR would not be set properly. [pr:2517]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-video>` where setting the `hidden` attribute would not hide it causing `<wa-video-playlist>` to show multiple videos at once. [pr:2501]
- Fixed a race condition with `<wa-accordion>` and `<wa-accordion-item>` causing a hydration mismatch in SSR [pr:2501]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-checkbox>` and `<wa-switch>` where `.checked` property would not properly update the shadow dom checkbox. [pr:2481]
- Fixed a bug where `@lit-labs/ssr` was not included as a dependency. [pr:2501]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-button>` where the slotted icon was rendered off-center at `size="xs"` in Firefox [issue:2426] [pr:2467]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-tooltip>` that caused the tooltip to hide when hovering over HTML content [pr:2512]

:::

:::changed

- Synced default `--show-duration`, `--hide-duration`, and `--easing` values in `<wa-accordion-item>`, `<wa-date-input>`, `<wa-time-input>`, `<wa-toast>`, and `<wa-video>` with `--wa-transition-*` tokens [pr:2485]
- Updated Native Styles so that `<th>` borders only apply to column headers [pr:2492]
- Removed `wa-prose`'s top margin on `h1` elements that follow a sibling

:::

:::removed

- Removed `--wa-accordion-divider-color` from `<wa-accordion-item>` due to improper scope and limited usage [pr:2491]

:::

- Fixed a bug in `<wa-video>` where the `timeupdate` method was not emitting when seeking or scrubbing the timeline [issue:2393]

- Fixed a regression in `<wa-breadcrumb-item>` that caused items without an `href` to render as a link instead of a button [pr:2400]
- Fixed a regression in `<wa-popover>` where the body's viewport-edge margin caused the popover and arrow to be misaligned for `top/bottom-start` and `top/bottom-end` placements
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-textarea>` where the disabled state had no visual styling, unlike other form controls [issue:2416]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-icon>` that caused some FA icons to not render based on `currentColor`
- Fixed default show/hide animations in `<wa-dropdown>`, `<wa-popup>`, `<wa-popover>`, `<wa-select>`, `<wa-details>`, `<wa-dialog>`, `<wa-drawer>`, and `<wa-tree-item>` to honor `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-drawer>` that caused the `light-dismiss` option not work as intended [pr:2437]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-dropdown>` that prevented items from being visible when the selected overflowed [pr:2430]

:::

:::changed

- Updated from `qr-creator` to `@konnorr/qr-creator` NPM package to facilitate `<wa-qr-code>` improvements. [pr:2139]
- Synced default `--show-duration` and `--hide-duration` values in `<wa-dropdown>`, `<wa-popup>`, `<wa-popover>`, `<wa-select>`, `<wa-combobox>`, `<wa-details>`, `<wa-dialog>`, `<wa-drawer>`, `<wa-tree-item>`, and `<wa-toast-item>` with `--wa-transition-fast` and `--wa-transition-normal` tokens [pr:2423]
- Synced hardcoded transitions in `<wa-copy-button>`, `<wa-select>`, `<wa-combobox>`, and `<wa-toast-item>` with `--wa-transition-*` tokens [pr:2427]
- Improved the vertical placement of content within `<wa-textarea>` and `textarea` when the content overflows the control [pr:2424]
- Updated Native Styles for several text elements [pr:2459]:
  - Updated `<blockquote>` to use a quiet text color and a font-size based on `--wa-font-size-larger`
  - Updated `<h6>` to use `--wa-font-size-xs`, further distinguishing small headings from surrounding body text
  - Updated `<table>` to use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` so numeric columns align
  - Updated `<th>` to render a visually stronger bottom border, distinguishing the header row from body cells
  - Added `<figcaption>` (previously unstyled): quiet text color, smaller font-size, condensed line-height, and a small top margin
  - Added `<ul>` and `<ol>` markers using `currentColor` with reduced opacity; `<ol>` markers retain more contrast since numerals are text rather than graphical elements
- Added Native Styles for `<menu>` (previously unstyled) to reset `list-style`, `margin`, and `padding` [discuss:2436] [pr:2450]
- Renamed `wa-text-wrap-nowrap`, `wa-text-wrap-balance`, and `wa-text-wrap-pretty` to `wa-text-nowrap`, `wa-text-balance`, and `wa-text-pretty` to align with the flat `wa-text-*` utility namespace. The original class names continue to work as aliases. [pr:2403]

:::

:::deprecated

  - Deprecated `small`, `medium`, and `large` in favor of `s`, `m`, and `l` (old values will continue to work in 3.x)
- Added `beforeinput` event to `<wa-number-input>` stepper buttons so value changes can be cancelled with `event.preventDefault()` [issue:2296] [pr:2310]

:::

:::fixed

- Fixed a bug in `<wa-details>` and native `<details>` that caused full-width elements to overflow the details content [issue:2137]
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-slider>` that introduced a `required` attribute which isn't valid on range elements [issue:1471]
- Fixed horizontal layout styles in `<wa-card>` that used invalid or non-matching `::slotted()` selectors for the body and actions regions [pr:2198]

:::

:::changed

- Improved `<wa-tree>` and `<wa-tree-item>` so all internal dimensions (labels, checkboxes, expand buttons, etc.) scale proportionally with `font-size`, making it easy to resize the tree [discuss:2147]

Selecting it adds a real `<wa-option>` to the DOM. Fires a cancelable `wa-create` event for custom handling.
  - Added `input` event dispatching to `<wa-combobox>` when the user types, matching the behavior of `<wa-input>` and native form controls
  - Fixed a bug in `<wa-combobox>` where custom values were not committed on blur when `allow-custom-value` was set
  - Fixed a bug in `<wa-combobox>` where clearing the input and blurring would restore the previous selection instead of clearing the value
  - Removed the `autocomplete` property from `<wa-combobox>` since it conflicted with the native HTML attribute
- Improved `<wa-select>`, `<wa-combobox>`, and `<wa-option>` performance with large numbers of options by batching slot changes, caching options, and lazily rendering check icons
- Improved `<wa-card>`: the `body` part wraps the default slot in a container instead of on the slot, preserving normal slot display and accessibility [pr:2198]
- Improved `<wa-tab-group>`: the `body` part wraps the default slot in a container instead of on the slot, consistent with `<wa-dialog>` and `<wa-card>` [pr:2212]
- Updated `<wa-zoomable-frame>` with an opt-in attribute for theme syncing [pr:2165]
- [Docs]: Updated space, gap, stack, and cluster documentation for the new tokens and utilities [issue:1606]

## 3.0.0-beta.1

We're excited to share the first beta release of Web Awesome, which includes some breaking changes that make the library significantly more intuitive and consistent!

The list looks extensive, but that's because we've tried to be thorough in documenting every change. We expect most users will only encounter a few of these during their upgrade. The majority are simple attribute renames (like clearable becoming with-clear) and component simplifications that actually reduce the amount of code you need to write.

**If you're a Web Awesome alpha user, please read through these release notes carefully!**

Many of these changes and improvements were the direct result of feedback from users like you! These changes represent our commitment to getting the fundamentals right as we move from alpha into a more stable beta release.

:::breaking

- `input` and `change` events on form controls like `<wa-input>` now are always set to `bubble` and `compose`.
- Greatly simplified how native styles work and removed redundant utilities

  - Clarified which utilities classes can be applied to which native elements
- Renamed the `classic` theme to `shoelace`
- Removed `:root` selector from all theme, color palette, and semantic color stylesheets except for the default theme and colors. All of these styles are now solely scoped to classes, such as `.wa-theme-awesome`, `.wa-palette-bright`, and `.wa-brand-orange`.
- Removed most custom properties from components that can otherwise be styled with `::part()` selectors and standard CSS properties.
- `<wa-dropdown>` was reworked and simplified to not use menu, menu item, menu label; use `<wa-dropdown-item>` instead
- Renamed `pulse` attribute in `<wa-badge>` to `attention="pulse"` and added `attention="bounce"` [issue:940]
- Renamed the `vertical` attribute to `orientation="vertical"` in `<wa-split-panel>` and `<wa-divider>` to align with other components and the platform [issue:674]
- Renamed certain boolean attributes to be consistent using the `with-*` and `without-*` pattern:
  - `<wa-button caret>` => `<wa-button with-caret>`

  - `<wa-input clearable>` => `<wa-input with-clear>`
  - `<wa-select clearable>` => `<wa-select with-clear>`
  - `<wa-tab-group no-scroll-controls>` => `<wa-tab-group without-scroll-controls>`

  - Removed `--wa-size`, `--wa-size-smaller`, `--wa-size-larger`, `--wa-space`, `--wa-space-smaller`, and `--wa-space-larger`
  - Added tokens for `--wa-form-control-padding-inline`, `--wa-form-control-padding-block`, and `--wa-form-control-toggle-size`
  - Refactored default `--wa-font-size-*` values to use an apparent 1.125 ratio and round rendered values to the nearest whole pixel
  - Added convenience tokens for `--wa-font-size-smaller` and `--wa-font-size-larger`
  - Updated components to use relative `em` values for internal padding and margin wherever appropriate
- Removed the `hint` property and slot from `<wa-radio>`; please apply hints directly to `<wa-radio-group>` instead
- Redesigned `<wa-slider>` with extensive new functionality
  - Added support for range sliders with dual thumbs using the `range` attribute
  - Added vertical orientation support with `orientation="vertical"`
  - Added visual markers at each step with `with-markers`
  - Added contextual reference labels with the `reference` slot
  - Added tooltips showing current values with `with-tooltip`
  - Added customizable indicator offset with `indicator-offset` attribute

:::

:::added

- Added Theme Builder to create your own themes

:::

## 3.0.0-alpha.12

:::added

- Added `label` attribute and `defaultLabel` property to `<wa-menu-item>` to override the generated label (useful for rich content)

:::

:::

- Dropped `getTextLabel()` method from `<wa-option>` (if you need dynamic labels, just set the `label` attribute dynamically)

:::

## 3.0.0-alpha.10

:::breaking

- 🚨 BREAKING: updated all components to use native events instead of `wa-` prefixed events. This will allow components to work more like native elements in your code, frameworks, third-party plugins, etc. To update your code, simply remove the prefix from your event listeners for the following events.
  - `wa-input` => `input`
  - `wa-change` => `change`
  - `wa-blur` => `blur` (this event will no longer bubble, use `focusout` for a bubbling version)
  - `wa-focus` => `focus` (this event will no longer bubble, use `focusin` for a bubbling version)

:::

:::added

- Added `.wa-callout` utility class
- Added the `orientation` attribute to `<wa-radio-group>` to support vertical and horizontal radio items
- Added docs for visual tests
- Added docs on how to cherry-pick native styles

:::

:::fixed

- Fixed a bug in `<wa-tab-group>` that prevented nested tab groups from working properly
- Fixed slot names for `show-password-icon` and `hide-password-icon` in `<wa-input>` to more intuitively represent their functions
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-textarea>` that caused empty controls to submit a value if the initial value was deleted a certain way
- Fixed a bug in `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` styles that prevented full-width controls from using 100% width when wrapped in a `<label>`
- Fixed a bug in `<select>` styles that caused the caret to block interactions and prevented the caret from rendering unless wrapped in a `<label>`
- Fixed a bug in `<wa-checkbox>` that caused hints to render inline with the label

:::

:::changed

- Changed the behavior of the `variant` and `size` attributes so that nested components that support these attributes but do not have them set inherit the values set on their ancestors. Additionally:
  - Added `size` attribute to `<wa-dropdown>`, `<wa-button-group>`, `<wa-menu>`, `<wa-rating>`, `<wa-card>`
  - Added `variant` attribute to `<wa-button-group>`

:::

:::

  - Changed the value of `--wa-border-radius-scale` to `1` and updated calculations of size-based `--wa-border-radius-*` tokens
  - Decreased the size of the scale so that `--wa-border-radius-s` is now the smallest border radius token, matching the value of the previous `--wa-border-radius-xs` token
